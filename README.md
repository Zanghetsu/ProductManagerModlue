# Product Manager Module

## Introduction

This is a solo project, with the aim to create a stand alone product manager application, that can later be integrated into newly developed managment applications, that utilize some kind of product/storage management.

The first iteration of the application utilizes only Java (within the boundaries of a maven project), and further down the line in the next iterations, it will be refactored into a stand alone spring boot application, with n-tier architecutral layout (as this enfolds, this section will be updated).

As describe above, the project development follows agile methodology.

## Requirements
